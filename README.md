# Amenintarea Maimutei - Software Engineering Team (UBB-SE-2025)

## 🏥 Hospital Management System
Welcome to the **Amenintarea Maimutei** team repository! This project was developed as part of the **Software Engineering Course 2024-2025** at UBB, Group 927, Team #4. Our team built part of a **Hospital Management Application** using **C# + .NET with WinUI** for the frontend and **SQL Server** for the database.

### 🔄 **Project Continuation**
The continuation of this project, including further development and enhancements, can be found in the linked repository here: [Continuation Repository](https://github.com/SDarius22/UBB-SE-2025-TeamBabes-From-AmenintareaMaimutei)

## 📌 Project Overview  
Our team was responsible for implementing the **admin panel and patient feedback system** within the larger Hospital Management System. This included:  
- **Admin Features**: Secure authentication, hospital data management (doctors, equipment, departments, rooms, schedules), shift assignments, salary calculations, and full CRUD operations.
- **Patient Features**: A feedback system allowing patients to submit reviews and ratings with input validation.  

Our work on this module is now complete, and the project will be further developed by another team.
