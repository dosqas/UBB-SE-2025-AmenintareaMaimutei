# Amenintarea Maimutei - Software Engineering Team (UBB-SE-2025)

## 🏥 Hospital Management System
Welcome to the **Amenintarea Maimutei** team repository! This project was developed as part of the **Software Engineering Course 2024-2025** at UBB, Group 927, Team #4. Our team built part of a **Hospital Management Application** using **C# + .NET with WinUI** for the frontend and **SQL Server** for the database.

### 🔄 **Project Continuation**
The continuation of this project, including further development and enhancements, will be carried out by **TeamBabes (Group 926)**. You can find the updated repository here: [Continuation Repository](https://github.com/SDarius22/UBB-SE-2025-TeamBabes-From-AmenintareaMaimutei)

## 📌 Project Overview  
Our team was responsible for implementing the **admin panel and patient feedback system** within the larger Hospital Management System. This included:  
- **Admin Features**: Secure authentication, hospital data management (doctors, equipment, departments, rooms, schedules), shift assignments, salary calculations, and full CRUD operations.
- **Patient Features**: A feedback system allowing patients to submit reviews and ratings with input validation.  

Our work on this module is now complete, and the project will be further developed by the next team.
